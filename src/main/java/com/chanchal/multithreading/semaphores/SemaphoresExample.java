/**
 * Semaphore is a technique used to control access to common resource for
 * Competing multiple processes. Semaphore maintains a counter which keeps
 * track of the number of resources available. When a process requests access to
 * resource, semaphore checks the variable count and if it is less than total
 * count then grants access and subsequently reduces the available count.
 * 
 * Semaphore is just a gatekeeper guarding the resources. If available grants
 * access and otherwise asks the processes to wait.
